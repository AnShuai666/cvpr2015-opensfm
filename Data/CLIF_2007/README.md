CLIF 2007 Sample Data
=====================

This subdirectory contains a very small sample of the CLIF 2007 data set
which is provided by the U.S. Air Force and available publicly for download
from [SDMS](https://www.sdms.afrl.af.mil/index.php?collection=clif2007).

The sample of data provide here contains only 250 frames from one camera
(Camera 0) in the CLIF tiled sensor array.  Furthermore, the image resolution
has been downsampled by a factor of 4 in both width and height, and the images
have been encoded as JPEGs.  The sensor metadata files (i.e. from GPS/IMU) for
the provided frames are also provided in the Air Force POS file format.
